# Mozilla Code Coverage

This project has 3 parts:

- `bot` is a Python script running as a Taskcluster hook, aggregating code coverage data from Mozilla repositories,
- `backend` is a Python API built with Flask, that serves the aggregated code coverage data, in an efficient way,
- `frontend` is a vanilla Javascript SPA displaying code coverage data in your browser.
