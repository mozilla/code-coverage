# Mozilla Code Coverage Backend

This project is a Python 3 REST API, powered by [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) that serves code coverage data aggregated by the bot project.

The production instance of this service is hosted on https://api.coverage.moz.tools

We currently have several endpoints implemented:

- `/v2/extensions` lists all the file extensions supported by the code coverage suite,
- `/v2/latest` lists the 10 latest code coverage reports ingested on the backend and available to query,
- `/v2/history` shows the code coverage progression for a specific path in a repository,
- `/v2/path` provides the code coverage information for a directory or file in a repository, at a given revision.

## Setup instructions for developers

```shell
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 ccov-backend
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run tests and linting:

```shell
pre-commit run -a
```

## Run a redis instance through docker

```shell
docker run -v /tmp/ccov-redis:/data -p 6379:6379 redis
```

## Run the webserver

The development webserver will run on **http://localhost:8000**

You need to setup a local YAML configuration file, with the following content:

```yaml
---
common:
  APP_CHANNEL: dev
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE: null
```

Using your local configuration:

```shell
LOCAL_CONFIGURATION=/path/to/code-coverage-conf.yml ./run.sh
```

You can specify a firefox-ci Taskcluster secret (e.g. project-relman/code-coverage/dev) instead using:

```shell
TASKCLUSTER_SECRET=path/to/secret ./run.sh
```
