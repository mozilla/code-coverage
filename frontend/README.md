# Mozilla Code Coverage frontend
This is a simple JavaScript application displaying information from the Mozilla code coverage backend (hosted as https://coverage.moz.tools)

You can use it right now from  [mozilla.github.io/code-coverage-reports](https://mozilla.github.io/code-coverage-reports/)

## File viewer

You can browse the aggregated code coverage data for mozilla-central, per directory, then view file coverage in detail.

## Zero coverage reports

We've also [developed a page](https://mozilla.github.io/code-coverage-reports/zero_coverage_report.html) to easily browse the directories & files with no coverage: these files are interesting because they can sometimes be removed altogether from mozilla-central...
